tuw_object_estimation
===

This repository contains a ROS package for object tracking as well as one to record statistical information about objects in a static map.
The packages are mainly used for people tracking, hence the descriptions here focus on that. Nevertheless, everything that is 
implemented here can in principle be used for arbitrary objects given the appropriate detections and motion models.
